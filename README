=== Part 1: Data Manipulation with Python ===

I initially skipped over the instruction to "Change the script to display sales info for Monday instead of Tuesday."

=== Part 2: Data Modeling ===

The "owners" table holds potential owners with their requested animal specifications. It would be a good idea to include owner contact information too, like email and phone.

Note that I performed the "Join" using an implicit join by selecting from two tables and adding the "join" ties in the where clause. According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44917/explicit-vs-implicit-sql-joins, the performance of explicit and implicit joins is the same. I prefer implicit joins because there's less typing involved.
